# Week 6: Loops
When answering questions in this assignment, please label each question in your codebase as a comment.  For example, if you are answering question 1 from this README, make a comment like this in `Program.cs`
```
// Question 1
<coded answer goes here>
```

1. Create a list of integers and populate it with 4 elements (2 of them even numbers, 2 of them odd numbers).  Iterate through that list using foreach.  For each iteration, if a number is even, print "even".  If a number is odd, print "odd".

1. Add two more integers to your list.  Using a for loop, iterate over every result and print it to the screen using console.writeline.

1. Create a new integer and give it a value of 0.  Now make a while loop that runs when the integer is less than 10.  In each iteration, print the value of the int then increment it by 1.

1. The value of your integer should be 10.  Create a do while loop that also runs when the integer is less than 10.   In each iteration, print the value of the int then increment it by 1.

1. Now for some more complex code.  Create a multidimensional array with 2 rows having 5 elements each and pre-populate it.  Write some code that will allow you to iterate over EVERY ELEMENT of the multidimensional array.  You will need to do some googling to figure this one out.

1. Create an int array with 10 elements.  Populate it but DO NOT have them in ascending order. Using what you know of loops (and some research done in google) sort the array in ascending order.  DO NOT use a built in method like .Sort() to do this!
